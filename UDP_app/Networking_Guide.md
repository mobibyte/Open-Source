## This is a networking example for IOS

UDP, which means User Datagram protocol, just sends data.
TCP, which mean Transmission Control Protocol, sends the data, but ensures that it gets sent.

## Python Scrips folder.
Of course, you will need the python code to be ran on a Rasberry Pi.
With the port and ip specified, it should send a message to that specific Port and IP.

That's really about it, the rest is for you to experiment with. It's like Dark Souls, you gotta grind and learn to gain victroy over an obstacle. 

* There is also an Iphone for those who are coding with IOS devices.

## NOTES:
_For Python_
* SOCK_DGRAM == UDP
* SOCK_STREAM == TCP
